/**
 * Inter-clip transitions. A transition describes how a clip ENTERS from the
 * previous one — both clips render simultaneously during the transition
 * window so backgrounds blend cleanly (no black flash on white→white cuts).
 *
 * Rendering is delegated to `@remotion/transitions`. This module owns the
 * serializable schema, the mapping to presentations/timings, and the
 * project-default fallback.
 *
 * First clip has no transition (nothing to come from). Project-level
 * `defaultTransition` applies to any non-first clip that doesn't set its
 * own override.

 * Crucially, BOTH clips stay at scale >= 1 for the whole
 * window so neither ever exposes its edges (a clip scaled below 1 reveals the
 * empty area behind it, which reads as an ugly black border — the old bug).
 *
 * "in": the camera keeps pushing forward through the cut. The outgoing clip
 * scales up from 1 -> 1+AMT as it fades out; the incoming clip starts already
 * pushed in at 1+AMT and settles back to 1 as it fades in. Because the visible
 * clip is at scale 1 at each boundary (outgoing at progress 0, incoming at
 * progress 1) and only ever larger in between, the motion is seamless and
 * full-frame the entire time.
 *
 * "out": the mirror — the incoming clip pushes in from 1+AMT while the outgoing
 * holds, giving a gentle pull-into-the-new-scene feel.
